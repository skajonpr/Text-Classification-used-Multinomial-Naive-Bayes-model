# Text-Classification-used-Multinomial-Naive-Bayes-model

This program is to show how to build a Multinomial Naive Bayes model to classify text with 2 classes.
This program was done based on Python3 using Machine Leaning library Scikit-learn.

**Program Steps**
- First apply grid search with 5-fold cross validation to find the best values for parameters min_df, stop_words, and alpha of Naive Bayes model that are used the modeling pipeline.
